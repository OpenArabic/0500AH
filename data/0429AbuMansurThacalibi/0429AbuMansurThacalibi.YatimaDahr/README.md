## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

All three texts are based on the same edition of which PDFs are available. The Shia version has virtually no mark up. In some regards, the JK version is better, for example it has correctly identified Quran verses and around PageV01P056 uses a chapter heading instead of a biography heading. However, much further in the document it failed to identify subchapters, whereas the Shamela version has those. It will be quicker to mark up the Shamela version, assuming that the Quran verses can still be automatically identified.


## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

Same pagination for the 1986 edition of Dar al-kutub al-ilmiya


## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

Don't know yet.

## 4. Add any comments on the text

Should I also tag 'fasl'?

What to do with lines 2695-2697

Missing vol. pag. numbers

line 2893, page 178, it really says 34, not 24

Line 5335, I don't think it should be a header and it shouldn't be tagged.

Line 5895, page 333. Half a page missing.

8460 page number missing

8804 actually skips to 40.

9432-9433: page 518 entirely skipped

9550 still page numbers missing

10067 should I just add the "8-"

Done until 10261

10359 احمد instead of أحمد

10714 should it be a header?

11144 no page numbers

A lot of headers between 106 and 107

14523 should basmala be a header?

15196 اسأل instead of أسأل

15270 وامره instead of with a hamza

15367 weird tag?

15795 digitized reads المديح but edition is المدح

16988 no page number

Finished 19348 / vol. 3
